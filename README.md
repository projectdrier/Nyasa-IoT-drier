# Nyasa-IoT-drier
Final year Computerscience project
The project is about an internet of things food drier: it has an android app for starting or stopping the drying process via the internet. 
Once the drying has been started, it is able to adjust temperatures itself so that the drying is within the optimum drying temperatures of the food item selected on the android app.
the drier system has the capability of turning itself off once the drying process has finished.

The following materials were used :
  Raspberry pi 2, heating element, 2 fans, relays, android studio for android app development(app can run on devices with android                      version  4 and above),temperature/humidity sensor, female-male connectors + male-male connectors.
